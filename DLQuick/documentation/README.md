## Setup

- The actual application is in the DLQuick folder, named <code>DLQuick.exe</code>, together with the <code>DLQcontent.txt</code> and <code>incidents.txt</code> files, which are vital for the app to function correctly.
- The <code>.gitignore</code> file and the <code>srcs</code> folder are useless if you don't plan to edit the app's source code and make a pull request. you can delete them. You can move the rest to anywhere in you computer, as long as the 3 files are in the same folder.
